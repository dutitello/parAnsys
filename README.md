# parAnsys
A Python module to do some parametric analysis on ANSYS software, it includes some reliability methods.

### ANSYS is a paid software!

# ToDo:
1) Create aliases for variables, like fy4=Normal(50, 0.05) and fy2=fy3=fy4. (same random value)
2) FORM Method: the final gradient could not be the correct gradient! It's because of tolRel?
