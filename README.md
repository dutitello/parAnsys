# parAnsys
A Python module to do some parametric analysis on ANSYS software, it includes some reliability methods.

**Docs are available in https://dutitello.github.io/paransys/**

### ANSYS is a paid software!

# ToDo:
1) Create aliases for variables, like fy4=Normal(50, 0.05) and fy2=fy3=fy4. (same random value)
   
2) Add some R and S to FORM-ANSYS variables, this way it could know if grad is right or not (is it real? R is always positive?)
